# COMPANY End of Week Briefing ‚Äì 2025-07-10

_This week's briefing addresses the confluence of mounting climate urgency, heightened regulatory scrutiny, and emerging investment opportunities within the green and blue economies. Record-breaking temperatures underscore the escalating financial risks associated with climate inaction, while increased government and investor focus is driving efforts to combat greenwashing. Against this backdrop, Temasek's robust portfolio performance, bolstered by strategic investments in sustainable sectors, validates the potential for strong returns in ESG-aligned strategies and signals increased capacity for future green investments. New collaborative initiatives, such as the partnership between Kadin, BRIN, and the Indonesian Ministry, aim to de-risk sustainable projects through enhanced research and development, creating attractive entry points for institutional capital. Looking ahead, we anticipate a greater emphasis on rigorous due diligence and impact measurement as investors seek to navigate the evolving landscape and capitalize on opportunities in scientifically-backed, high-impact sustainable projects._
