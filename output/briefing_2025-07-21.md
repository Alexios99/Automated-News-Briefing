# COMPANY End of Week Briefing – 2025-07-21

_This week's briefing highlights several emerging trends impacting sustainable investment strategies. From Malaysia's workforce development programs potentially influencing ESG assessments to calls for a more inclusive global financial architecture resonating within the G20 framework, shifts in policy and priorities are becoming evident. Conversely, regulatory challenges persist, as seen in the US contemplating withdrawal from the IEA and the limited availability of rated sustainable financial institutions in Bangladesh. Finally, heightened ESG risks, exemplified by illegal logging in Liberia, demand increased due diligence. Institutional investors must navigate this complex landscape by diversifying data sources, enhancing risk assessments, and actively seeking opportunities for impact investments, particularly in emerging markets facing sustainability challenges._
