<h1>SAFL End of Week Briefing ‚Äì 2025-06-28</h1>
<p><em>This week's briefing highlights the convergence of public and private capital accelerating the sustainable finance landscape, from significant investments in nature-based solutions alongside supportive government policies like the UK's Industrial Strategy to the strategic value of ESG-proficient "boomerang employees" enhancing corporate sustainability initiatives. Simultaneously, emerging market opportunities in Brazil's green economy and China's clean technology dominance, while potentially lucrative, introduce geopolitical complexities requiring careful consideration. Looking ahead, we anticipate a greater focus on strategic partnerships and risk mitigation strategies as institutional investors navigate the evolving global landscape of sustainable finance and green/blue economy capital deployment.</em></p>
