<h1>SAFL End of Week Briefing ‚Äì 2025-06-23</h1>
<p><em>This week's briefing explores the evolving landscape of sustainable finance, highlighting both opportunities and challenges for institutional investors. A lack of standardization in ESG metrics continues to impede efficient capital allocation, while increasing scrutiny around greenwashing necessitates enhanced due diligence. On a positive note, regulatory tailwinds in Australia and proactive corporate action, such as Primaris REIT's green finance framework and Kings Infra Ventures expansion in Andhra Pradesh's aquaculture, are creating tangible investment avenues. With La Caisse surpassing its sustainable investment targets and countries like Singapore and Indonesia prioritizing collaborative green initiatives, investors are faced with growing opportunities in both green and blue economies, yet challenges remain in harmonizing ESG metrics and the implementation of anti-greenwashing legislation. Going forward, we anticipate increased demand for standardized ESG reporting frameworks and innovative financial instruments that effectively support the sustainable development of both terrestrial and marine ecosystems.</em></p>
